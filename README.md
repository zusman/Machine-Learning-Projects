Malaria Predicition 


Malaria Prediction This project predicts Malarial outcomes based on Hematological parameters using Artificial Neural Networks. For this project we used clinical data from research paper "Machine learning approaches classify clinical malaria outcomes based on haematological parameters". Morang’a, C.M., Amenga–Etego, L., Bah, S.Y. et al. BMC Med 18, 375 (2020). https://doi.org/10.1186/s12916-020-01823-3

Aim of the Project 
Machine learning (ML) approach i.e. artificial neural network (ANN) with three hidden layers was used for multi-classification non-malarial infections (nMI), uncomplicated malaria (UM), and severe malaria (SM) using 15 haematological parameters. RBC count, WBC count, Neutrophils %, Neutrophils Count, Mixed Cells %, Mean Cell Hb Concentration, Mixed ells Count, Platelet Distribution Width, Mean Cell volume, RBC Distribution Width %, Platelet Count, Lymphocyte Count, Lymphocyte %, Mean Corpuscular Hb, Mean Platelet Volume.

Getting the Dataset 
The dataset can be downloaded from the supplementary material of the the research paper using following link. https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-020-01823-3#Sec21 Download the Additional file 2.Table S2 which is in XSlX format. To use this file convert xslx file into csv file
